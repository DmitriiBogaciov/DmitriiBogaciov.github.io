                <p>
                    Is the capital and most populous city of France, with an estimated population of 2,175,601 residents
                    as of 2018, in an area of more than 105 square kilometres. Since the 17th century, Paris has been
                    one of Europe's major centres of finance, diplomacy, commerce, fashion, gastronomy, science, and
                    arts. The City of Paris is the centre and seat of government of the region and province of
                    Île-de-France, or Paris Region, which has an estimated population of 12,174,880, or about 18 percent
                    of the population of France as of 2017. The Paris Region had a GDP of €709 billion ($808 billion) in
                    2017. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit Worldwide Cost of Living Survey in 2018, Paris
                    was the second most expensive city in the world, after Singapore and ahead of Zürich, Hong Kong,
                    Oslo, and Geneva.[7] Another source ranked Paris as most expensive, on par with Singapore and Hong
                    Kong, in 2018.

                            <p>The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France.
                                It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the
                                tower.</p>
                            <p>Locally nicknamed "La dame de fer" (French for "Iron Lady"), it was constructed from 1887
                                to 1889 as the entrance to the 1889 World's Fair and was initially criticised by some of
                                France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, but it has become a global
                                cultural icon of France and one of the most recognisable structures in the world. The
                                Eiffel Tower is the most visited monument with an entrance fee in the world; 6.91
                                million people ascended it in 2015.</p>
                            <p>The tower is 324 metres tall, about the same height as an 81-storey building, and the
                                tallest structure in Paris. Its base is square, measuring 125 metres on each side.
                                During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become
                                the tallest man-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the
                                Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930. It was the first structure in
                                the world to surpass both the 200-metre and 300-metre mark in height. Due to the
                                addition of a broadcasting aerial at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller than
                                the Chrysler Building by 5.2 metres. Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the
                                second tallest free-standing structure in France after the Millau Viaduct.</p>

                                Notre-Dame de Paris referred to simply as Notre-Dame, is a medieval Catholic cathedral
                                on the Île de la Cité in the 4th arrondissement of Paris. The cathedral was consecrated
                                to the Virgin Mary and is considered to be one of the finest examples of French Gothic
                                architecture. Its pioneering use of the rib vault and flying buttress, its enormous and
                                colourful rose windows, as well as the naturalism and abundance of its sculptural
                                decoration set it apart from the earlier Romanesque style. Major musical components that
                                make Notre Dame stand out include its three pipe organs, one of which is historic; and
                                its immense church bells.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The cathedral's construction began in 1163 under Bishop Maurice de Sully and was largely
                                complete by 1260, though it was modified frequently in the following centuries. In the
                                1790s, Notre-Dame suffered desecration during the French Revolution; much of its
                                religious imagery was damaged or destroyed. In the 19th century, the cathedral was the
                                site of the coronation of Napoleon I and the funerals of many presidents of the French
                                Republic.

                                The Louvre is the world's most-visited museum and a historic monument in Paris, France.
                                It is the home of many of the most known work of arts, including the Mona Lisa. A
                                central landmark of the city, it is located on the Right Bank of the Seine in the city's
                                1st arrondissement (district or ward). Approximately 38,000 objects from prehistory to
                                the 21st century are exhibited over an area of 72,735 square meters.

                                The museum is housed in the Louvre Palace, originally built in the late 12th to 13th
                                century under Philip II. Remnants of the Medieval Louvre fortress are visible in the
                                basement of the museum. Due to urban expansion, the fortress eventually lost its
                                defensive function, and in 1546 Francis I converted it into the primary residence of the
                                French Kings. The building was extended many times to form the present Louvre Palace. In
                                1682, Louis XIV chose the Palace of Versailles for his household, leaving the Louvre
                                primarily as a place to display the royal collection, including, from 1692, a collection
                                of ancient Greek and Roman sculpture. In 1692, the building was occupied by the Académie
                                des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres and the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture,
                                which in 1699 held the first of a series of salons. The Académie remained at the Louvre
                                for 100 years. During the French Revolution, the National Assembly decreed that the
