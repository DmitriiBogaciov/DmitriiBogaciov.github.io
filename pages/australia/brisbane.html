                <h1>Brisbane</h1> <!--city name and information about the city-->
                <p>
                    Brisbane land of the Turrbal Country, is the capital and most populous city of the Australian state
                    of Queensland, and the third-most populous city in Australia. Brisbane's metropolitan area has a
                    population of around 2.6 million, and it lies at the centre of the South East Queensland
                    metropolitan region, which encompasses a population of around 3.8 million. The Brisbane central
                    business district is situated within a peninsula of the Brisbane River about 15 km (9 mi) from its
                    mouth at Moreton Bay, a bay of the Coral Sea. The metropolitan area extends in all directions along
                    the hilly floodplain of the Brisbane River Valley between Moreton Bay and the Taylor and D'Aguilar
                    mountain ranges. It sprawls across several of Australia's most populous local government areas
                    (LGAs) — most centrally the City of Brisbane, the most populous LGA in the nation.
                    The city is named for the Brisbane River on which it stands, which is in turn named for Sir Thomas
                    Brisbane, the governor of New South Wales at the time of the city's founding. The Moreton Bay penal
                    settlement was founded in 1824 at Redcliffe as a place for secondary offenders from the Sydney
                    colony, and soon moved to North Quay in 1825. Christian missionaries established Zion Hill in 1838,
                    and by 1842 the region opened to free settlement. Brisbane was chosen as the capital when Queensland
                    separated from New South Wales in 1859, and by the late 19th century had grown into a major port
                    city and centre of immigration. During World War II, Brisbane played a central role in the Allied
                    campaign and served as the South West Pacific headquarters for United States Army General Douglas
                    MacArthur.
                    Brisbane is classified as a global city (Beta +), and is an advanced centre of research and
                    innovation in the Asia-Pacific. The city is promoted as Australia's capital of technology, with
                    strengths in mining research and green energy, medicine and biotechnology, cryptocurrency and
                    digital industries, and robotics. A transportation hub, Brisbane is served by a large suburban rail
                    network and popular bus and ferry networks, as well as Australia's largest and busiest airport, and
                    the third largest seaport. The financial district is centered on Eagle Street.

                            <p>One of the best ways to go sightseeing in Brisbane is aboard a river cruise. The Brisbane
                                River runs through the heart of the city, and many of the city's top attractions line
                                its banks, vying for your attention. This is an excellent way to gain a fresh
                                perspective of Brisbane landmarks such as the Story Bridge, Kangaroo Point Cliffs, and
                                even some of the wildlife, like the fruit bats that gather along the mangroves on the
                                riverbank.
                                Once you experience a scenic overview of the city on the water, you can get your
                                bearings, and pinpoint places to spend more time during your visit.
                                River City Cruises run some of the most popular tours. They range from 90-minute morning
                                or afternoon cruises to sunset cruises and longer excursions. A great choice is the
                                3.5-hour Cruise to Lunch Package. Along the way, your guide will share fascinating
                                stories about Brisbane's history, and point out key Brisbane attractions, all while you
                                enjoy Devonshire tea with glittering river views.
                                Kookaburra River Queens offers lunch, high tea, and dinner cruises aboard their
