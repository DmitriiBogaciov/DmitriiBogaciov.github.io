                <h1>Sydney</h1> <!--city name and information about the city-->
                <p>
                    Sydney is the capital city of the state of New South Wales, and the most populous city in Australia
                    and Oceania. Located on Australia's east coast, the metropolis surrounds Port Jackson and extends
                    about 70 km (43.5 mi) on its periphery towards the Blue Mountains to the west, Hawkesbury to the
                    north, the Royal National Park to the south and Macarthur to the south-west. Sydney is made up of
                    658 suburbs, spread across 33 local government areas. Residents of the city are known as
                    "Sydneysiders". As of June 2020, Sydney's estimated metropolitan population was 5,367,206, meaning
                    the city is home to approximately 66% of the state's population. Nicknames of the city include the
                    'Emerald City' and the 'Harbour City'.
                    Indigenous Australians have inhabited the Sydney area for at least 30,000 years, and thousands of
                    engravings remain throughout the region, making it one of the richest in Australia in terms of
                    Aboriginal archaeological sites. Around 29 clan groups of the Eora Nation inhabited the region at
                    the time of European contact. During his first Pacific voyage in 1770, Lieutenant James Cook and his
                    crew became the first Europeans to chart the eastern coast of Australia, making landfall at Botany
                    Bay and inspiring British interest in the area. In 1788, the First Fleet of convicts, led by Arthur
                    Phillip, founded Sydney as a British penal colony, the first European settlement in Australia.
                    Phillip named the settlement after Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney. Penal transportation to
                    New South Wales ended soon after Sydney was incorporated as a city in 1842. A gold rush occurred in
                    the colony in 1851, and over the next century, Sydney transformed from a colonial outpost into a
                    major global cultural and economic centre. After World War II, it experienced mass migration and
                    became one of the most multicultural cities in the world. At the time of the 2011 census, more than
                    250 different languages were spoken in Sydney. In the 2016 Census, about 35.8% of residents spoke a
                    language other than English at home. Furthermore, 45.4% of the population reported having been born
                    overseas, and the city has the third-largest foreign-born population of any city in the world after
                    London and New York City. Between 1971 and 2018, Sydney lost a net number of 716,832 people to the
                    rest of Australia but its population has continued to grow, largely due to immigration.

                                One of the world's great icons, the Sydney Opera House is a UNESCO World Heritage Site
                                and the star attraction on the glittering harbor. This graceful building, shaped like
                                shells or billowing sails, perches on a finger of land surrounded by water.
                                You have several options for visiting the Sydney Opera House. Snap a photo while gliding
                                by on a harbor cruise, relax at one of the restaurants, stroll around its exterior, or
                                take an organized tour of this magnificent structure. Inside, you'll find theaters,
                                studios, exhibition rooms, a concert hall, and cinema.
                                Book a Sydney Opera House Guided Walking Tour to learn about the history and get a
                                behind-the-scenes look at this famous building. This is a flexible ticket that allows
                                you to join any one of the tours throughout the day, departing every half hour from 9am
                                to 5pm.
                                Avid photographers should head to Mrs Macquarie's Chair for one of the best photo

                                Note that the building is undergoing a 10-year, $275-million upgrade, but it will
                                continue to operate during the restoration.

                                Nicknamed the "Coathanger," the Sydney Harbour Bridge is another Sydney icon. Supported
                                by massive double piers at each end, it was built in 1932 and remains the world's
                                largest steel arch bridge. You can drive over it, cruise below it, chug over it on a
                                train, or photograph it from afar. But one of the best ways to appreciate this marvel of
                                engineering, and soak up the spectacular views of Sydney Harbour, is on a climb to its
                                135-meter-high summit.
                                Scaling the bridge is one of Australia's top outdoor adventures, and you can choose from
                                a range of different tours. Sydney BridgeClimb takes groups on an approximately 3.5-hour
                                climb to the top of the outer arch. Tours run throughout the day, beginning with a dawn
                                climb and ending with a night climb. You can also choose from different types of climbs,
                                including an Indigenous storytelling experience and a climb right across the arch to the
                                other side – the bridge connects the harbor's north and south shores.
                                Guided ascents of the bridge include a pre-climb prep talk, safety gear, and a photo on
                                the summit. Along the way, you'll learn all kinds of entertaining stories about the
                                history of the bridge. One of its most famous workers was non other than Paul Hogan, aka
                                Crocodile Dundee, before he became famous.
                                To learn more about the fascinating history of the bridge's construction, visit the
                                museum in the southeastern pier.
