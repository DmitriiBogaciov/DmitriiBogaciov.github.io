      <h1>Cusco</h1> <!--city name and information about the city-->
      <p>
        Cusco, often spelled Cuzco is a city in southeastern Peru near the Urubamba Valley of the Andes mountain range. It is the capital of the Cusco Region and of the Cusco Province. The city is the seventh most populous in Peru and, in 2017, had a population of 428,450. Its elevation is around 3,400 m.
      </p>
      <p>
        The city was the capital of the Inca Empire from the 13th century until the 16th-century Spanish conquest. In 1983, Cusco was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO with the title "City of Cuzco". It has become a major tourist destination, hosting nearly 2 million visitors a year. The Constitution of Peru (1993) designates it as the Historical Capital of Peru.

              Sacsayhuamán is a citadel on the northern outskirts of the city of Cusco, Peru, the historic capital of the Inca Empire.
              The complex was built by the Inca in the 15th century, particularly under Pachacuti and successors. They built dry stone walls constructed of huge stones. The workers carefully cut the boulders to fit them together tightly without mortar. The site is at an altitude of 3,701 m.
              In 1983, Cusco and Sacsayhuamán together were designated as sites on the UNESCO World Heritage List, for international recognition and protection.

              The Templo de la Sagrada Familia (Temple of the Holy Family) also called Templo de Jesús, María y José, is a Renaissance church located in the city of Cusco, Cusco Region, Peru. This building was designed by Francisco Becerra. On September 13, 1723, the first stone was placed to begin the construction of the Templo de la Sagrada Familia by order of Bishop Gabriel de Arregui following the design of Francisco Becerra. After the death of the architect in charge of the work, it was re-started in 1733 and was completed on September 3, 1735.
              In 1996, with the support of the Archbishopric of Cusco and the European Union, the temple was restored after it was closed about 30 years.
